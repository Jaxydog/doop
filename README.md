# Doop!

> ⚠️ Doop is currently a work-in-progress! Here be dragons! ⚠️

Doop is an open-source Discord bot whose primary purpose is to assist administrators with server management, while also providing other features such as polls.

### Why doop?

Doop is the culmination of a good amount of time [creating](https://github.com/Jaxydog/Spanky) [various](https://github.com/Jaxydog/MrManager) [Discord](https://github.com/Jaxydog/spanky-rs) [bots](https://github.com/Jaxydog/mr-manager) and an even longer time of disliking premium bots like Mee6. Doop will always be free and completely open-source, while providing many features that I personally find useful.

If you want to suggest a feature, feel free to contact me via Discord or [create an issue](https://github.com/Jaxydog/doop/issues).

### No.. why _"doop"_?

The name Doop doesn't really have any meaning if I'm honest. I just drew the icon and thought it would be a suitable name. And it's a funny noise to make.

### Why _not_ doop?

Well to be honest I'm not planning on having this be very big. I'm expecting this to be in just a few small servers, and maybe one or two decently-sized community ones that I run with my friends.

If you need something that is meant for a large-scale server with several thousands of people, this might not be the bot for you.
