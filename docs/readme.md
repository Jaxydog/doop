# doop!

Doop is an open-source Discord bot whose primary purpose is to assist administrators with guild management, while also throwing in some fun features such as polls.

## Why doop?

Doop is the cumulation of a good amount of time [creating](https://github.com/Jaxydog/Spanky) [various](https://github.com/Jaxydog/spanky-rs) [Discord](https://github.com/Jaxydog/MrManager) [bots](https://github.com/Jaxydog/mr-manager) and an even longer time of not liking bots like Mee6. Doop will always be free and completely open-source, while providing features that I find useful.

If you want to suggest a feature, feel free to contact me via Discord or [create an issue](https://github.com/Jaxydog/doop/issues).

## No.. why _"doop"_?

The name Doop doesn't really have any meaning if I'm honest. I just drew the icon and thought it would be a suitable name. And it's a funny noise to make.

## Why _not_ doop?

Well to be honest I'm not planning on having this be very big. I'm expecting this to be in just a few small servers, and maybe one or two decently-sized community ones that I run with my friends.

If you need something that is meant for a large-scale server with several hundreds of people, this probably isn't the bot for you.
