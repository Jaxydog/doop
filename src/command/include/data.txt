All data stored by this bot abides by the rules below.
To see exactly how data the data is used, you can view the bot's [source code](https://github.com/Jaxydog/mr-manager).

**__Data used for the purpose of bot functionality__**
Publicly available data such as public user identifiers or values input into commands may be stored to ensure all bot features work as intended.
This type of data should be only stored as strictly necessary.

Any data within this category is either already able to be viewed by other users, input directly by the user through commands or modals, or generated by the bot from other stored data.

**__Data used for the purpose of record-keeping__**
This almost always comes in the form of logs of past actions, such as interaction results or errors.
This type of data may be stored and deleted arbitrarily, as it isn't essential to bot functionality.

All data within this category is collected from user interactions.

**__Data used for the purpose of feature enhancement__**
This is usually similar, if not the same, as record-keeping data.

Data within this category is collected through a mixture of public information, collected data logs, and generated data.

Stored data will __never__ be shared with anyone; this project is made entirely for fun and I do not wish to profit off of it.
For any concerns, you can contact me directly <@206260650010345483>.
